Architecture

The architecture used in this application focuses on using the Express framework which utilizes Node.js in VS Code. Using Node.js facilitates the applications performance which makes creating functioning APIs for the application. The front end side of things uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with Express and Angular. Using angular, I was able to create a single-page application for authentication.
NoSQL MongoDB database is used for all the user data in the application. These database have flexible models, fast query times, and easy to use especially in the Mongoose GUI. 

Functionality

Using JSON, I was able to create data that could be used by Javascript objects. The data can be used to affect what happens on the client-side by taking the data and making into readable javascript code. The data also can be used in multiple areas in the app. 
Refactoring is a great way to make clean code. It helps improve performance and readable code. Through the project, I took static HTML files and created handlebars where I would take large html code and create a s single handlebar for it. I could use that handlebar in other areas of the code that would use the HTML code. 

Testing

The ways I tested was to first go the localhost of the application and see if the app loads correctly. If any issues, I used google debugging tools such as the console to see what errors there are. VS code is great also for debugging and investigate issues. Another way was to use the terminal for the angular app in VS code and go to the local host to test the SPA. 

Reflection

This course has helped me see how complicated web development can be! Much of this course focused installation, MVC routing, SPA, and my favorite was adding & editing a trip. I’ve studied some HTML, CSS, and Javascript but I did not use things like Angular before this course. I was impressed how something like Angular could easily create a SPA without much effort for the developer. The toughest part of this course was to remember what linked with what and authentication. Using the Mongoose db was no too complicated, I did like the GUI. Overall, it was a great experience and I can see why it’s such a desired skill in the market.
