# CS330 Module 7 Project

How do I approach designing software?
I first lay out the important components on a diagram and formulate a plan on how to execute each process. In this course we had tutorials that helped guide me along the way to create the final project.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I learned how to use C++ in an entirely different way. I built shapes and created lighting sources. I learned more about arrays and the different ways we can use them to create shapes.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an waterfall approch. In order to complete the final project, I needed to understand all previous modules. This is in my opinion, a waterfall method. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think it could help me create logos if I ever needed to for a company.

How do I approach developing programs?
With a diagram to start. Then laying out a UML diagram, listing the functions needed etc.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I tried to not get too overwhelmed and not panic. Understanding previous tutorials helped me accomplish the rest of the work. Understanding how to create a plane, cube, cylinder, triangle, light source, texturing, shading, orbiting, etc. The hardest part was adding multiple objects and light sources to a 3D scene. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
It helped with shapes and light sources.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It helped to keep up with the work or else I would not have been able to complete the project. Following the tutorials were a great help towards my overall success.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
CS has shown me a wide range of possibilites. It's not just focused on coding, howver, this course involved alot of code but in a different way.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I think if I wanted to get into UX Design, this course would be helpful for sure.
